 Types of Permissions (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
	SELECT – Allows a user to read data from a table. Users can view rows and columns but cannot change anything.
 	INSERT – Allows a user to add new rows into a table.
 	UPDATE – Allows a user to modify existing data in specific columns or entire rows.
 	DELETE – Allows a user to remove rows from a table.
These permissions control what actions a user can perform on database objects.

Describe the concept of schema-level permissions vs. table-level permissions.
Schema-level permissions apply to all objects inside a schema.
Example:
Granting permissions on  Schema GA1 gives access to every table in the GA1 schema.
• 	Table-level permissions apply only to a specific table.
Example:
Granting SELECT on GA1.EmployeeData affects only that table, not others in the schema.
Schema-level permissions are broader, while table-level permissions are more targeted.

Explain how column-level permissions work and why they might be useful.
Column-level permissions allow you to control access to specific columns within a table.
For example:
	Denying SELECT on the Salary column prevents a user from seeing salary data, even if they can view the rest of the table.
	Granting UPDATE on only FirstName, LastName, Department allows IT to update those fields but not Salary.
Column-level permissions are useful when certain data is sensitive (like salaries) and should only be visible or editable by specific roles.

Discuss the principle of least privilege and how it's applied in this RBAC setup.
The principle of least privilege means giving users only the minimum permissions they need to do their job — nothing more.
In this RBAC setup:
	HR gets full access because they manage employee records.
	Sales gets read-only access and cannot see salary data.
 	IT can update technical fields but cannot change salary information.
This reduces the risk of accidental or intentional misuse of data.

Explain the potential security benefits of using roles instead of assigning permissions directly to users.
Assigning permissions to roles instead of individual users provides several advantages:
 	Consistency – Every user in the same job role gets the same permissions.
	Easier management – You only update the role once instead of updating each user.
 	Scalability – New users can be added quickly by assigning them to a role.
 	Security – Reduces mistakes and ensures permissions follow organizational rules.
Roles make permission management cleaner, safer, and easier to maintain.
